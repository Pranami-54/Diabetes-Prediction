# Diabetic Prediction Using SVM

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes in patients using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and a web application for predicting diabetes based on user input.

## Files Included
- **Diabetic_using_svm.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation using SVM.
- **diabetes.csv**: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **diabetic_prediction_web_app.py**: Python script for the web application that allows users to input patient data and receive diabetes predictions.
- **predictivesystem.py**: Python script containing the function to preprocess input data and predict the outcome using the trained SVM model.
- **trained_model.sav**: Serialized SVM model trained on the diabetes dataset.

## Deploy the Model
- Model is deploy using stremlit library
- 
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pickle, stremlit
